VGATEST
================================================================================
Simple DOS program used to test VGA functionality in both text and graphics
modes.

It can be compiled with Open Watcom and needs the DOS/4GW extender.

Alphanumeric (A/N) tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Font Maps demo
--------------
This demo shows the double font map capability of the VGA that can be used to 
display 512 different characters on screen.
Font map 0 is the default BIOS map.
Font map 1 is a 8 pixels wide BIOS map loaded with INT 10/AX=11--h
Font maps 2-7 are custom maps.

Keys:
0 to 7 = change Map A's font.
ESC    = exit


Split & Pan demo
----------------
This demo shows the split screen and panning features.

Keys:
ARROW UP    = increase vertical panning value
ARROW DOWN  = decrease vertical panning value
ARROW LEFT  = decrease horizontal panning value
ARROW RIGHT = increase horizontal panning value
PAGE UP     = decrease split screen scanline value
PAGE DOWN   = increase split screen scanline value
ESC         = exit


Benchmark
---------
Performs a series of video memory access speed tests. Two values are given:
MB/s = the memory bandwidth of the video subsystem in megabytes per second;
fps = how many times per second a single video page can be filled with a fixed
character / attributes pair. This is an ideal condition and represents the
maximum fill rate.
Both values depend not only on the video card and bus speeds but also on the
CPU performance.

Keys:
ESC = exit
r   = repeat tests


Video modes available
---------------------
Name    Format   Box    Resolution
0,1     40x25    8x8    320x200
0*,1*   40x25    8x14   320x350

        80x28    9x14   720x400
        80x30    8x16   640x480 (multisync monitor only)
        80x34    8x14   640x480 (multisync monitor only)
        80x60    8x8    640x480 (multisync monitor only)

BEWARE: modes 80x30, 80x34, and 80x60 require a multisync monitor and they may
        damage very old VGA only 31.5 kHz monitors.



All Points Addressable (APA) tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Circles demo
------------
Shows a bunch of concentric circles that rapidly change their color. Useful to
check the screen aspect ratio.

Keys:
ESC = exit


Lines demo
----------
Shows two lines (green and red) that rotates in opposite directions. In video
modes with only one available page the lines could be only partially drawn (it
depends on how fast the CPU, bus, and VGA are).

Keys:
ESC = exit


Palette demo
------------
Fills the screen with the color palette.

Keys:
ESC = exit


Worms demo
----------
Draws a bunch of worms that crawl on the screen.

Keys:
ESC = exit


Split & Pan demo
----------------
This demo shows the split screen and panning features.

Keys:
ARROW UP    = increase start address value
ARROW DOWN  = decrease start address value
ARROW LEFT  = decrease horizontal panning value
ARROW RIGHT = increase horizontal panning value
PAGE UP     = decrease split screen scanline value
PAGE DOWN   = increase split screen scanline value
M           = change Pixel Panning Mode value
ESC         = exit

MB/s = the memory bandwidth of the video subsystem in megabytes per second;

color value. This is an ideal condition and represents the maximum fill rate.
Both values depend not only on the video card and bus speeds but also on the

BEWARE: modes 160x120 and 400x300 require a multisync monitor and they can
        damage very old VGA only 31.5 kHz monitors.
